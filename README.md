# Model_Development

Objectives

Use Linear Regression in one variable to fit the parameters to a model
Use Linear Regression in multiple variables to fit the parameters to a model
Use Polynomial Regression in single variable tofit the parameters to a model
Create a pipeline for performing linear regression using multiple features in polynomial scaling
Evaluate the performance of different forms of regression on basis of MSE and R^2 parameters
